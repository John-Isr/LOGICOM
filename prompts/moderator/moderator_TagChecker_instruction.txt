There is a debate between assistant and user.
Your job is to Check if the assistant is sending correct signal.
The conversation is about the 
topic:  " <TOPIC> " 
claim: "<CLAIM>"
reason: "<REASON>"
I want you to check if the message means that the user is convinced(agree) the claim "<CLAIM>" is correct or not. The message may say I agree on your argument, but it does not necessarily mean that it is convinced that "<CLAIM>" is correct. 

Analyze the provided context and determine if the user is convinced about the main claim. Respond STRICTLY in JSON format with a single key "is_convinced" whose value is a boolean (true or false).

Example Response:
{
  "is_convinced": false
}

Do not include any other text or explanation outside the JSON object.
